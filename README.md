# Cric-Live: Real-Time Cricket Companion

A lightweight, high-performance web application designed to track real-world cricket matches in real-time. Built with a focus on speed, aesthetics, and minimal data overhead.

## Core Objective
To provide a premium "Second Screen" experience for cricket fans, offering live scores, automated insights, and immersive visual cues similar to the CricFuzz simulation engine.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Preact + Vite (for ultra-fast load times)
- **State Management**: @preact/signals (for reactive UI updates)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with a focus on premium aesthetics (glassmorphism, vibrant accents)
- **Data Source**: External Cricket APIs (e.g., CricketData.org / RapidAPI)

## Key Features
- **Live Score Ticker**: 30-60s polling for real-time score updates.
- **Match Mindset**: Automated interpretation of the match state (e.g., "India is cruising", "Australia under pressure").
- **Immersive Visuals**: Subtle color flashes and animations for boundaries and wickets (legacy of CricFuzz).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for easy tracking on any device.
